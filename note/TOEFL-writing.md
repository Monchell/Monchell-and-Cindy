> tpo33 一篇例文  
部分题目节选：Carved stone balls are a curious type of artifact found at a number of locations in Scotland. They date from the late Neolithic period, around 4,000 years ago. They are round in shape; they were carved from several types of stone; most are about 70 mm in diameter; and many are ornamented to some degree. Archaeologists do not agree about their purpose and meaning, but there are several theories. 
>  
> **Three theories proposed by the reading passage about** the purpose and meaning of the carved stone balls, a type of artifact dating from the late Neolithic period, **are challenged in the following lecture**.  
> 
> **The reading passage states that** the carved stone balls were used as weapons for hunting or fighting, **while the lecturer views this issue from an opposite angle. According to her, this theory is unconvincing.** If they were used as weapons, they would show signs of damage, but the surface of the stone balls is well-preserved, making it impossible that they were weapons.   
>  
> **Contrary to the belief in the reading passage that** the stone balls were used as standard weights to measure quantities of food, **the lecturer argues that this theory doesn’t hold water.** Since the masses of stone balls made of different types of stone with different density vary, the stone balls with different weights cannot be used in the primitive weighing system.  
>   
> **According to the reading passage,** the stone balls were used to mark the social status of their owners because of their elaborate designs. However, the lecturer contends that this theory is not persuasive. **For one thing**, although some of the stone balls have elaborate designs, some have markings that are too simple to be status symbol. **For another thing**, when people during the Neolithic period died, they would be buried with their possessions. But there were no stone balls found in tombs, meaning that they were not personal possessions to mark social status. 

### 1.3.2. 一个论点+三个理由类  

- Tips:  
    听听力的时候，一定要注意，听力是反驳理由，还是反驳理由推不出结论。  

- 开头段:  
    The assumption in the reading passage that ...is challenged in the following lecture.  

- 其余类似上一类型
    
> tpo11 一篇例文
> 
> **The assumption in the reading passage that** the teenage girl in the professionally painted portrait is Jane Austen, a famous English novelist, **is challenged by the following lecture**.
>
> **The reading passage states that** the permission from Austen’s family to use the portrait as an illustration in Austen’s works suggests that the girl in the portrait is Jane Austen, **while the lecturer views this issue from an opposite angle. According to him**, (even with the permission, the girl in the portrait might not be Jane Austen.) when Austen’s family gave the permission, Jane Austen had been dead for more than 70 years, meaning that family members at that time might not have the chance to see Austen in person and they might not know whether the girl in the portrait was Jane Austen. 
> 
> **Contrary to the belief in the reading passage that** the resemblance between the face in the portrait and the one in Cassandra’s sketch, which is known to depict Austen, indicates that the girl in the portrait is Jane Austen too, **the lecturer argues that** the subject of the portrait might be one of Austen’s relatives. Austen had a big family and her female cousins or cousins’ children can resemble her. Furthermore, some experts believed that the true subject of the portrait was Austen’s distant niece. 
> 
> **According to the reading passage,** the portrait was painted when Austen was a teenager (because of its style linking to Humphrey who was active when Austen was the age of the girl in the painting). **However, the lecturer contends that** when the portrait was painted, Jane Austen was no longer a teenager because the stamp on the portrait indicates that the canvas of the portrait was sold by a man who didn’t start to sell canvas until Jane Austen was 27 years old. 

# 二、独立写作

<h3 id=212> 2.1.2. 主体段</h3> 

主体段（150-200 words）：topic sentence + 说理 + 例证([个人事例](#21221)、[列举](#21222)、[数例](#21223)) + 总结    

#### 2.1.2.1. 说理：step by step
> eg. 发展公共交通可以让空气变好。  
> Developing the public transportation system can help improve the air quality. Why is this so? With an extensive public transportation system, citizens would be more willing to take the bus or the subway to go out instead of driving their own Ford, Toyota, etc., leading to less car exhaust, which consists of major air pollutants, and as a result, the air we are breathing now would be fresher and cleaner. 

#### 2.1.2.2 例证   

以下例子都用一个题目来写：国内商品 or 国外商品？

- <p1 id=21221>个人事例：编故事（过去式）</p1>
> With the technology developing fast and **the manufacturing standards in China catching up with the standards in developed countries**, some of our **domestic products** even can have a better performance than foreign goods in terms of quality and **aftersales service**. For example, our family had been using a TV from Changhong, one of the best TV brands in China, for more than a decade. Never had it shown any glitch although we used it on a daily basis. Last year, with the OLED technology being applied in the TV industry, we **spent a fortune on** an ultra-thin OLED TV from Samsung, a South Korean TV brand. In the beginning, we were amazed at the screen with much higher resolution and brightness – everything seemed crystal clear and I could even see every hair of Cristiano Ronaldo in a shampoo commercial. However, the excitement didn’t last long. **Only after two weeks did little dots appear on the screen**. At the same time, the audio output started to malfunction as well. I called the customer service, hoping they could **fix the TV for me as soon as possible**. But they said that they couldn’t **have my TV repaired** because they had no store nor repairman in my small town unless I paid the freight to ship my TV to Shanghai. I so regretted replacing my Changhong, which **enjoyed good quality and convenient customer service**. This experience and many other similar cases from people around me have **completely shaken my firm faith on imported goods**. (251 words)


- <p1 id=21222>列举：一定要细节！！</p1>
> **Domestic products are often much cheaper than their foreign counterparts**. This phenomenon is especially true in China. **Why is this so? For one thing**, our government imposes high duties on imported products. **For another thing,** the labor cost in China, a heavily populated country, is much lower than the labor cost in countries like the U. S. and Germany. Both of the factors have resulted in the drastic difference in prices of goods. **Examples abound.** A newly launched iPhone 12 with the storage of 256G would cost as much as 1,500 dollars, while you only need to pay two thirds of the amount of money for a domestic smartphone with similar functions and features. **Likewise/Furthermore,** compared to a pair of Adidas sneakers from Germany with the price tag of 150 dollars, a pair of running shoes from a Chinese sports gear brand is more affordable. **The most striking example comes in the food market.** You need to spend 10 dollars on a kilo of beef from the nearest farm, which is already quite expensive. **However,** the same amount of beef imported from Australia is a luxury for everyday Chinese. **These instances all have told us that if we are still rational, we should go for products made in our own country.** (211words)

- <p1 id=21223>数例：写一个调查，写细节</p1>

> **Domestic products are often much cheaper than their foreign counterparts.** This phenomenon is especially true in China. **Why is this so? For one thing,** our government imposes high duties on imported products. **For another thing,** the labor cost in China, a heavily populated country, is much lower than the labor cost in countries like the U. S. and Germany. Both of the factors have resulted in the drastic difference in prices of goods. Recently, Apple Inc. launched its newest generation of iPhone, iPhone 12. **China Daily,** an English-language daily newspaper with millions of subscribers in China, **conducted a survey about whether people in China would like to buy this fancy smartphone.** According to the survey, **among 2,000 college students studying in Beijing, 80% of the them suggested that** they were reluctant to buy this American smartphone because of its prohibitive price, which was as much as 1,500 dollars. **In addition, most respondents indicated that** if they wanted to upgrade their phone, they were inclined to buy one from a Chinese tech company because the top-of-the-line domestic smartphone with similar features only listed for two thirds of the price of iPhone 12. **It is the relatively cheaper price of domestic products that drives us Chinese to buy everything made in our own country.** (212words)

<h3 id=213> 2.1.3. 结尾段</h3> 
    emmm 老师直接没讲，就自己总结总结呗。


## 2.2. 文章思路分析：
分析原因，分析利弊，让步段，拆分（分类讨论）

### 2.2.1. 让步段★：对方的观点 + **原因** + 反驳 ( 针对这个原因进行反驳 )  
反驳:
    1.	不重要  
    2.	黑白颠倒  
    3.	还有其他解决方案 (plastic surgery, influencer)  
    4.	直接否定对方的观点的原因(however, this is not the case in reality.)

> e.g. 国外旅游 or 国内旅游  
> 
> 国外旅游:  
> 1. experience something different … (broaden our horizon, learn something …)scenery, food, customs…  
> 2. cool  
> 3. 让步段：有的人说国外旅行不好，因为太贵了！但是，我就是因为贵才去！！（有其他的解决方案, research, promotions discounts…neighboring countries, developing countries…service, food, accommodation, transportation…）  
> 4. 让步段，有的人说国外旅行不好，因为不方便！但是！(直接反驳对方观点的原因，现在很方便…交通方便，intercontinental flight…applications, 当地交流购物等也方便… / 就是因为不方便才去，这样可以锻炼自己，independent skills… / 有其他解决方案，去方便的国家, English-speaking的国家，不要visa的国家，only requires visa on arrival, neighboring countries, jet lag, short flight time…)有的人说国外旅行不好，因为不安全！但是！（去安全的国家，比如说新加坡，东京等,和朋友们一起，参加旅行团 / 我就是因为不安全才去，adventure）

### 2.2.2. 关于“二选一”题材：
1. a 与 b 相互对立：可以直接想两个观点 or 用让步段
2. a 与 b 不相互排斥：选 a 写一段话，吐槽 b 再写一段（尽量用让步）

> e.g. 现在学校有一大笔钱，应该把这部分钱花在 hiring famous professors 还是花在 improving campus facilities  
> - famous professors:  
>       1. famous professor的好处：对学生的学习有好处/对学生的就业有好处/对学校有好处，reputation   
>       2. 吐槽campus facilities：有的人说应该花钱在campus facilities上，这样有利于学生的学习和生活。学校应该把钱花在图书馆上，学生就有好的学习环境，有书可以做参考有利于学习，花钱在sports field有利于学生锻炼身体。但是！都没必要的。with the development of technology, …
> 
> - campus facilities:   
>        1. 有利于学生的学习和生活：dorm，air conditioning, ensure every student has a private room, fewer distractions…/basketball court, soccer field, gym, indoor tennis court…/laboratories, computer lab  
>        2. 吐槽花钱 hire famous professors。有的人说学校应该花钱 hire famous professors，因为有了famous professors的帮助，学生们可以学得更好。但是！！！However, this is not the case in reality. class size/busy, teaching assistant…

### 2.2.3.  关于“三选一”题材：
选 a 写一段，分别吐槽 b 和 c   
> 高中生应该选下面哪个课程：个人理财，做菜，修车  
> 个人理财：
> 1. 个人理财
> 2. 做菜不应该学，skill很简单，不需要上一个课来学。修车也不应该学，没用，most cities in China enjoy an extensive public transportation system.

### 2.2.4. 关于古今对比题：  
一般从以下几个方面来考虑     
    - technology
    - $
    - time
    - government policy
    - environment
    - social awareness


### 2.2.5. 带绝对词的题： 
**the most, all, never, always…**  
Disagree:  
    1. dmittedly,确实挺重要的；
    2. However，不是最重要的，因为发展经济更重要。
> Agree or disagree: only movies that teach us something about real life are worth watching.  
Disagree:    
>    1. admittedly, …( parent-child relationship, put myself in her shoes…) Love Actually… never give up, Forrest Gump  
>    2. However, 但是，其他电影也是值得观看的，比如说 sci-fi movies，fantasy movies，因为 relax ourselves, temporary escape from the reality.

### 2.2.6. 分类讨论：
> Agree or disagree: improving schools is the most important for the successful development of a country.  
> 分类讨论(disagree)：  
>   1. developed countries 
>   2. developing countries (prioritize their economy)
